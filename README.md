# Understanding-the-world-s-oldest-businesses.

This project explores the characteristics and data of the oldest businesses around the world, particularly focusing on how they have stood the test of time. The dataset includes information on the oldest businesses, new businesses, countries, and business categories. The primary objective is to analyze the longevity of businesses and understand the factors that contribute to their sustained existence, such as their industry or geographic location.

Steps Taken:
Data Cleaning & Merging:

The datasets provided contain information on businesses (businesses), new businesses (new_businesses), countries (countries), and business categories (categories). These datasets were cleaned to ensure consistency and accuracy in the data.
Various joins were performed to combine relevant information from these datasets, such as business details, country names, and continent locations.
Key SQL Queries:

Oldest Business on Each Continent:
This query identifies the oldest business on each continent by joining the businesses, countries, and categories tables. The MIN(year_founded) function is used to find the earliest founded business in each continent. The query is structured to return the business name, founding year, and country.
Countries Without Data on Oldest Businesses:
This query calculates how many countries on each continent lack data on the oldest businesses. It uses a LEFT JOIN between the countries and a union of the businesses and new_businesses datasets. The business IS NULL condition helps identify countries without relevant business information.
Business Categories Suited to Last Centuries:
This query examines which business categories are best suited to survive for centuries by grouping businesses by continent and category. The MIN(year_founded) function is again used to identify the oldest businesses in each category per continent.
Analysis Focus:

The project aims to provide insights into which types of businesses (by category) and which regions (by continent) are most likely to produce long-lasting businesses.
The number of countries per continent lacking data on their oldest businesses helps identify potential gaps in available information.
Summary of Insights:
Longevity Factors: The longevity of businesses might be influenced by factors such as the industry (e.g., agriculture, hospitality), historical stability of the region, and adaptability to changing circumstances.
Geographic Trends: Some continents or countries may have more longstanding businesses due to their historical stability, economic conditions, and supportive environments for certain industries.


Skills:
Data Cleaning:

Identifying and handling missing or inconsistent data.
Combining multiple datasets to ensure data integrity and relevance.
SQL Querying:

Proficiency in writing SQL queries to manipulate and extract insights from the datasets.
Joins: Using JOIN operations to merge data from different tables (e.g., INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN).
Aggregation: Using functions like MIN(), COUNT(), and GROUP BY to aggregate data and extract meaningful insights.
Union: Using UNION ALL to combine data from multiple sources (e.g., merging businesses and new_businesses).
Filtering: Using WHERE clauses to filter data based on specific conditions (e.g., missing business data).
Data Analysis:

Analyzing trends, such as the oldest businesses in different regions and business categories that have lasted the longest.
Identifying patterns in business longevity by continent, category, and founding year.
Problem-Solving:

Identifying gaps in data (such as countries without information on the oldest businesses) and coming up with solutions to address these gaps in queries.
Tools:
SQL Database:

SQL was the primary tool used for querying and data manipulation. This could be done on a relational database management system (RDBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite.
SQL queries were run to join, filter, and aggregate the data from the different CSVs.
Spreadsheet Software (Optional for Visualization):

Tools like Excel or Google Sheets may have been used for further data exploration, especially for summarizing results and creating charts.
Data Cleaning Tools (Optional):

Pandas (Python Library) may have been used for more advanced data cleaning if the data was imported into a Python environment. It would be helpful for filtering, handling missing values, or transforming data before SQL queries were run.
Data Visualization Tools (Optional):

Tools like Tableau or Power BI could have been used to visualize the data once cleaned and joined. For example, creating maps to show business longevity by continent or bar charts to compare business categories across regions.
Summary:
SQL is the core tool for querying, joining, and manipulating the data.
Data Cleaning and Aggregation were key skills for handling and analyzing the data.
Data Analysis skills allowed for extracting insights related to business longevity, geographic trends, and category-specific longevity.
